         <h2>My learning journey</h2>

        <p>I started to learn html since 2024 June. But I actually started that last week. In these years, so many things happened in my study. I wanna tell you a little moments of my study.</p>

    <h3> 2024 projects</h3>
      <p>I started to learn programming from w3 school that is a free website to learn coding what I found from a youtube video. At first, I was comfused to start. I don't exactly know what is programming. So I picked a ramdom one,HTML. But the fact I became know only when I've learn about colors is that HTML is not a programming language. Then I decided to start learn real programming language.</p>

     <h3>2025 projects</h3>
     <p>In the beginning of Jan 25, I started to learn python with the chat gpt's help. 
        Before Jan, I found that python is the best for beginner,super eassy to learn programming language.I searched and downloaded the python files. Then I installed Virtual Studio Code IDE.And adjust the appropriate settings, and started to learn.After touching some variable names, I started stuff.I felt "No No...I'm not ready to learn this, it's too hard". Then I came back to learn html...
       </p>
       <h3>On going projects</h3>
       <p>Now, I'm just learning HtML. Whatever I encounter, I've decided to go ahead.</p>
